# OSS-Doorway

OSS-Doorway is a GitHub-native educational platform designed to support newcomer onboarding and learning in open-source software (OSS) projects. The system structures learning as a series of guided “quests” that students complete directly within GitHub repositories, reducing context switching while helping learners gain hands-on experience with real-world software engineering workflows. The project addresses common newcomer challenges such as difficulty finding a starting point, understanding project-specific conventions, and receiving timely feedback. By combining automated validation, structured tasks, and GitHub-native integrations, OSS-Doorway aims to make open-source participation more accessible, scalable, and educationally grounded.

Installation

OSS-Doorway does not require local installation for basic student usage, as interactions occur directly through GitHub. For developers or instructors who wish to deploy or extend the platform, the repository can be cloned using git clone, and the project runs on Python 3.8 or newer. Dependencies can be installed via pip using a requirements file where applicable. Additional configuration may be required for GitHub Apps, CI workflows, or database-backed features depending on deployment needs.

Usage

OSS-Doorway is used in instructional or training contexts where learners complete structured tasks within real open-source repositories. Instructors define quests consisting of activities such as opening issues, modifying code, running tests, or responding to feedback. Students complete these tasks directly on GitHub and receive automated validation and feedback. Progress tracking allows instructors and maintainers to monitor engagement and learning outcomes. This workflow supports authentic participation in OSS while lowering the barrier for newcomers.

Contributing

Contributions to OSS-Doorway are welcome. The project is intended to be community-driven and benefits from input by educators, students, and open-source maintainers. Contributors are encouraged to open issues to discuss changes before submitting pull requests and to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file if present. All contributors are expected to collaborate respectfully and adhere to the project’s code of conduct.
