## License Justification

We chose the **MIT License** because it is a permissive and widely adopted open-source license that aligns well with the goals of this project. The license allows others to freely use, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restrictions, which lowers barriers for adoption and contribution, especially for students, researchers, and industry practitioners. Its simplicity makes it easy for newcomers to understand their rights and responsibilities while still ensuring proper attribution to the original authors. This choice supports reuse in educational, research, and commercial settings and encourages broader community engagement without imposing strong copyleft requirements.
